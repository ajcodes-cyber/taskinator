# taskinator
A task management web app

## Recap of what was accomplished

* Added a form to the HTML document and learned a new HTML element, the 'select' dropdown element.

* Submitted forms using the submit event listener.

* Overrode default browser behavior by introducing event.preventDefault();

* Retrieved data from a form element using its value property.

* Used a new DOM element property, innerHTML, to write HTML code instead of simple text.

* Refactored the code to be reusable.

* Used simple form validation with if statements to prevent user errors in the application.

* Reset the form to its default state by using the reset() method on a form element.
